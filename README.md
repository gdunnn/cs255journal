Project documents for CS255
- Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

  DriverPass is a company that instructs future drivers about the fundamentals of driving while maintaining the rules and guidelines set by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). Liam, our client, has asked us to develop a program that can extend his instruction into the digital realm. In this program, users will be able to learn the rules of the road, set appointments, and share their experiences with the course for other users to see. 
  
- What did you do particularly well?

  I developed some stellar UML diagrams I think. It took a lot of studying and a few scrapped diagrams before I got to the ones I currently have. They really accurately describe the vital parts of the DriverPass system concisely.
  
- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  
  I would choose the buisness document. I feel like I glazed over the functionalities and could have really brainstormed some uniques things to include in the system. I feel like I just went to the features that were obvious, and didn't really get to venture outside of the box like I wanted to.
  
- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  
  By giving the students the freedom to choose their package, schedule appointments, and access materials and exams, we were able to accurately meet the needs of the students and meet the reuirements DriverPass required. This will bring the student's test passing average up (hopefully) and bring in more customers for the company because the students will have an easy time using the application.
  
- How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  I don't really know how I approach it just yet. There is still a ton of mystery involved in it, and each time I open an IDE it feels like I am in a dark forest and my only light is StackOverflow. This class taught me so much about laying out the design of a system before development starts, and has taught me how crucial it is for the success of the application. There are so many moving parts when it comes to coding, and I feel like from this point forward I will always utilize UML diagrams to better understand and visualize how my code will operate.
